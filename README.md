![Spectro Logotype](./src/lib/brand/logotype/banner-dark.svg)

Spectro is a [Discord bot][spectro-invite-link] that enables your community members to post anonymous confessions and replies to moderator-configured channels. However, for the sake of moderation, confessions are still logged for later viewing.

# Development

Spectro is a standard full-stack [SvelteKit][Svelte] web application that uses [PostgreSQL] as the database layer.

[Svelte]: https://svelte.dev/
[PostgreSQL]: https://www.postgresql.org/

## Managing Environment Variables

For convenience, the repository includes `env:*` scripts for loading environment variables from `.env.*` files. These are meant to be used as prefixes for other package scripts.

```bash
# Run the database migrations with `.env.development` variables.
pnpm env:dev pnpm db:migrate

# Register the Discord application commands.
pnpm env:prod pnpm discord:register
```

## Managing Local Services

Spectro uses Docker Compose to run local development services:

- **PostgreSQL** (`db`): The database layer for data persistence (port `5432`).
- **Inngest** (`inngest`): A local Inngest dev server for background job processing (port `8288`).
- **OpenObserve** (`o2`): A web UI for visualizing OpenTelemetry traces and logs (port `5080`).

The following environment variables are required for the database to work.

| **Name** | **Description** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL` | The URL connection string for the PostgreSQL development database. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | The password with which to initialize the default `postgres` user. |

```bash
# Start all local development services.
# Requires `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
docker compose up --detach

# Run the database migrations.
# Requires `POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL` already in scope.
pnpm db:migrate

# Shut down all local development services.
docker compose down
```

Once running, OpenObserve is accessible at `http://localhost:5080` with the default development credentials:

- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `password`

## Registering Callback Endpoints

The bot relies on two callback endpoints that receives webhook events from Discord:

1. The **interactions endpoint** (i.e., [`/webhook/discord/interaction/`][spectro-discord-interaction]) for [receiving application commands][discord-interactions] via HTTP POST requests from Discord.
1. The **webhook events endpoint** (i.e., [`/webhook/discord/event/`][spectro-discord-event]) for receiving [application authorization][discord-application-authorized] events from Discord.

[spectro-discord-interaction]:./src/routes/webhook/discord/interaction/+server.ts
[spectro-discord-event]:./src/routes/webhook/discord/event/+server.ts
[discord-interactions]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/overview#preparing-for-interactions
[discord-application-authorized]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/events/webhook-events#application-authorized

## Registering the Application Commands

To register the application commands in Discord, a one-time initialization script must be run whenever commands are added, modified, or removed. The script is essentially a simple HTTP POST request wrapper over the Discord REST API.

```bash
# Register the application commands.
# Requires `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` already in scope.
curl --request 'PUT' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header "Authorization: Bot $DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" --data '@discord.json' "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/$DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID/commands"
```

## Developing Spectro

Spectro requires some environment variables to run correctly. If the following table is outdated, a canonical list of variables can be found in the [`src/lib/server/env/*.ts`](./src/lib/server/env/) files.

| **Name** | **Description** | **Default** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | The public key of the Discord application that will be used for the verification of incoming webhooks. | |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | The secret key of the Discord application that will be used for the verification of OAuth2 client credential flows. | |
| `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` | The event key used to send events to Inngest. | |
| `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` | The signing key used to verify incoming webhook requests from Inngest. | |
| `POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL` | The URL connection string for the PostgreSQL production database. | |
| `SPECTRO_DATABASE_DRIVER` | The database driver to use. Accepts `pg` for the standard driver or `neon` for the Neon serverless driver. | `pg` |

The following variables are optional in development, but _highly_ recommended in the production environment for [OpenTelemetry](#opentelemetry-instrumentation) integration. The standard environment variables are supported, such as (but not limited to):

| **Name** | **Description** | **Recommended** |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | The base OTLP endpoint URL for exporting logs, metrics, and traces. | `http://localhost:5080/api/default` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Extra percent-encoded HTTP headers used for exporting telemetry (e.g., authentication). | `Authorization=Basic%20YWRtaW5AZXhhbXBsZS5jb206cGFzc3dvcmQ%3D` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | The underlying exporter protocol (e.g., JSON, Protobufs, gRPC, etc.). | `http/protobuf` |

> [!NOTE]
> The "recommended" values are only applicable to the development environment with OpenObserve running in the background. See the [`compose.yml`] for more details on the OpenObserve configuration.

[`compose.yml`]:./compose.yml

### Local Telemetry with OpenObserve

To enable full observability in local development:

1. Start the local services (including OpenObserve):

 ```bash
   docker compose up --detach
   ```

2. Export the OTEL environment variables before running the dev server:

 ```bash
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:5080/api/default'
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=Basic%20YWRtaW5AZXhhbXBsZS5jb206cGFzc3dvcmQ%3D'
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL='http/protobuf'
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. View traces and logs at `http://localhost:5080`.

In production deployments, the `OTEL_*` variables may be customized to export the telemetry data to external observability providers.

### Running the Web Server

```bash
# Install the dependencies.
pnpm install

# Synchronize auto-generated files from SvelteKit.
# This is automatically run by `pnpm install`.
pnpm prepare

# Start the development server with live reloading + hot module replacement.
pnpm dev

# Compile the production build (i.e., with optimizations).
pnpm build

# Start the production preview server.
pnpm preview
```

## Linting the Codebase

```bash
# Check Formatting
pnpm fmt # prettier

# Apply Formatting Auto-fix
pnpm fmt:fix # prettier --write

# Check Linting Rules
pnpm lint:eslint # eslint
pnpm lint:svelte # svelte-check

# Check All Lints in Parallel
pnpm lint
```

## OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

Spectro supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing and structured logging. The instrumentation is configured in [`src/instrumentation.server.ts`](./src/instrumentation.server.ts), which SvelteKit automatically loads on server startup.

- **Auto-instrumented**: HTTP requests and PostgreSQL queries are automatically traced.
- **Fallback behavior**: When OTLP endpoints are not configured, telemetry falls back to console exporters.
- **Graceful shutdown**: The SDK properly flushes pending telemetry data on server shutdown.

For local development, [OpenObserve](https://openobserve.ai/) is included in the Docker Compose setup (port `5080`) as a web UI for visualizing traces and logs.
